		<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
		<p>With <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/updates/2.2">140 new features and improvements</a>, Craft 2.2 is the biggest little release yet.<br>
			And this one’s all about the details.</p>
	</header>

	<h1>Position Select Fields</h1>
	<p><a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/docs/position-select-fields">Position Select</a> is a new field type that was written with Matrix in mind. It gives you a simple new way to define block positions when you’re using Matrix to create long-form articles.</p>

	<h1>Logout Warnings</h1>
	<p>The Control Panel now warns you when you’re about to be logged out, giving you the chance to extend your session with the click of a button, and get back to your writing.</p>
	<p>If you do get logged out, Craft will give you a dialog where you can quickly enter your password to be logged back in, without losing any work.</p>

	<h1>Single Titles and Statuses</h1>
	<p>Your Singles now have the same “Show the Title field?”, “Title Field Label”, and “Title Format” settings that your Channel and Structure sections have, and you can also toggle the status of your singles.</p>
	<img src="{{ resourceUrl('images/whats-new/single-edit-page.png') }}" alt="A single’s Edit page.">

	<h1>Security Improvements</h1>
	<p>Craft now supports <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/help/csrf-protection">CSRF Protection</a>, and <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/docs/rich-text-fields">Rich Text</a> fields have a new “Purify HTML?” setting, which will run their values through HTML Purifier before getting saved to the database, removing any potentially malicious code.</p>

	<h1>Lots more!</h1>
	<p>Craft 2.2 is packed full of other new features, improvements, APIs, and even a few bug fixes. Check out the <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/updates/2.2">release notes</a> for a complete list!</p>
